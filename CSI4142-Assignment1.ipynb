    "This report aims to analyze two datasets from distinct domains (healthcare and socio-economic demographics) to uncover meaningful insights through exploratory data analysis. The Heart Failure Prediction dataset is used to examine factors associated with heart failure outcomes, while the Adult Census Income dataset is analyzed to understand the relationship between demographic attributes and income levels. The report presents ten insights for each dataset supported by visual and numerical evidence. The target audience for this analysis includes students and readers with a general interest in data analytics who may not have a strong technical background. Therefore, the findings are presented in a clear and interpretable manner, with an emphasis on explanation and visualization.\n"

    "Purpose: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 17.9 million deaths annually (31% of all deaths worldwide), and early detection of heart failure risk can inform preventive care decisions (Fedesoriano). This dataset was created to support research into predicting heart disease (often used as a proxy for heart failure risk) using clinical and demographic indicators. It compiles clinical measurements and test results that are commonly associated with cardiovascular risk. The goal is to enable data exploration and machine learning modeling that can identify patterns associated with heart disease, which can help flag high-risk individuals for earlier medical intervention.\n",

    "Redundancy or Missing Values: Based on the dataset schema, there are no redundant features, as each column represents a distinct clinical or demographic attribute. The dataset schema does not indicate the presence of explicit missing values, as all features contain recorded entries for every observation. However, some numerical variables include zero values (for example the Cholesterol feature and the RestingBP feature) that may not be medically plausible and could implicitly represent missing or unrecorded measurements."
